# Music-Genre-Classification
A binary text-classification project, which classifies music lyrics as either Pop or Rap.

This project uses 3 different text classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forrest, to classify songs into genres based on their lyrical content.

The project uses multiple Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning techniques, and some ML libraries and APIs.
